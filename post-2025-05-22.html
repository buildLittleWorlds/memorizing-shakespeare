      <p>
        Today I began working on Sonnet 18. My strategy was to recite the first quatrain aloud repeatedly. 
        I noticed the rhythm is easier to memorize if I visualize the “darling buds of May.”

        Difficulties: Tripped over the line “Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines.” 
        Plan to repeat this section tomorrow.

        Highlight: The closing couplet feels very rewarding to say from memory.
